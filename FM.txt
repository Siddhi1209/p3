
The  c code which you have provided me is of very less size. sixe of the code which 
you provided me is 9386 byte but the original code size was 14094 bytes. that means 
many things are missing in the code. 
Also After implented the code i got complaint that queue_buildup_i_new.out file was not generating
in home path. ( Here i is dqp type). there were many lines in int main(int argc, char *argv[]) which were 
missing in the c program provided by you.

should i give you both the old c program and the c program you provided me for comparison.
