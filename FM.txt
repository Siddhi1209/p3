You can directly paste this as the final RCA.
Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
1. Brief description of the Incident
Post DB switch from Day to Reference (REF), queue buildup was observed in DP9Q across multiple application servers. This resulted in delay in message processing between REF and ARCHSBI systems.
2. Reason for the Issue
The incident occurred due to a DB link connectivity issue from REFNR 4th node to ARCHSBI. Although the ARCHSBI world entry was present at the Refrn node, the DB link from REF to ARCHSBI was not functioning properly, leading to queue buildup.
**3. Corrective Action Taken
(Action taken immediately to rectify the incident)**
PSO team brought up the queues as an immediate containment step to stabilize processing.
During monitoring, it was identified that the DB link from REFNR 4th node to ARCHSBI was facing connectivity issues.
DBA team added the required ARCHSBI world entry around 03:00 AM, restoring DB link connectivity.
After DB link restoration, PSO team flushed the accumulated queue buildup, validated connections from REF to ARCHSBI, and brought up fresh queues.
The issue was fully resolved by 03:30 AM.
**4. Preventive Action Taken
(Action taken to prevent the incident in future)**
Mandatory post DB switch validation of DB links across all REF nodes to be implemented.
A standard post-switch checklist to be followed covering DB link and connectivity verification.
Proactive monitoring to be strengthened for early detection of queue buildup.
Improved coordination between DBA and PSO teams during switch activities.
5. Chronological Sequence of the Incident
Post DB switch from Day to REF, queue buildup observed in DP9Q across multiple application servers.
PSO team brought up queues as an immediate containment measure.
On further monitoring, DB link issue identified from REFNR 4th node to ARCHSBI.
DBA team added the ARCHSBI world entry around 03:00 AM.
Post fix, PSO team flushed queue buildup, validated connectivity, and recreated queues.
Normal processing resumed and the issue was resolved by 03:30 AM.
6. Learning Point of the Incident (In details)
End-to-end DB link validation across all nodes is critical after DB switch activities.
Queue buildup can serve as an early indicator of backend connectivity issues.
Timely collaboration between PSO and DBA teams ensures faster identification and resolution.
Preventive validation steps significantly reduce operational risks during critical switchovers.
