Subject: Feedback on Job Section Implementation & Access Request

Dear Team,

We have reviewed the Job Section implementation shared by you. The current design is not aligned with our existing portal structure. Please note the following observations and required changes:

1. The present implementation is time-based whereas our requirement is a matrix-based live dashboard (Jobs vs Servers).


2. Status indicators are limited to ✓ and ✗, but our system uses multiple indicators (✔ OK, ⚠ No Data, – NA, ❌ Not Running, ❗ Timestamp Frozen, etc.) along with a legend for clarity.


3. Important fields like Check RC, System Idle, Last Update, Connectivity, Misc Job are missing.


4. Alerting is absent – any failures or issues should be highlighted immediately in red/orange, as in the current setup.


5. Only a few jobs are displayed, whereas the dashboard should include all gateways and servers (B24, ATM, INB, MR, TF Gateway, Trickle Feed, RTGS, NEFT, MQ Server, etc.).



Additionally, regarding your request for production server access to run scripts, please note that such access cannot be granted directly. You are requested to take formal approval from the Bank through the proper channel before proceeding.

Kindly align the design as per the current system and re-share for review.

Best Regards,
[Your Name]

Do you want me to also prepare a comparison screenshot table (Expected vs Delivered) to attach in the email for better clarity?
