
Dear [Approver's Name],

This is to inform you that the Region Switch banner script has been updated, and I am seeking approval for the same.

**Summary of Changes:**

1. The banner display condition has been modified:
   - Earlier: The script checked for job `REGION_BOUNCE` to determine banner state.
   - Now: It monitors the `AUTO_CHECK_DAY_SOD` job.
   - If `AUTO_CHECK_DAY_SOD` is running (`RU`), the banner shows the message:  
     "REGION SWITCH IS GOING TO START IN APPROX 5 MINUTES".

2. An additional timestamp line has been introduced:
   - When the banner condition is met, a secondary file `Ban2.txt` logs the job start time.
   - This message (e.g., “Pop up getting displayed : 8:42:00”) is also displayed on the portal **below** the main region switch message.

3. If the `REGION_BOUNCE` job is running, the banner will display nothing (value "00").

Requesting your kind approval for these changes.

Please let me know if any further details are required.

Regards,
