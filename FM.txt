I have a production portal.
the flow of this portal is as follows.
it is used for monitoring 16 application servers.
which have today's date in the MFLAGS and portal server also has todays date.
so script runs on these 16 application servers, this script generates a file
which is scp to portal server and in portal server there is a script merge_files_9apps which
merges all the file into 1 file and then .php code in portal reads and displays it.

Now i have to make another portal for another set of servers 
so my script is ready but MFLAGS date of these servers are differenr from portal server.

so how shoul i merge it.
i will give you merge_files_9apps script. Present in portal server.
