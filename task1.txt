I have website smart_krish.php which also includes monitorExternalFile1.php for additional contents of website. now i want to add 
a big pop up on smart_krish.php. this pop up should be displayed on smart_krish.php if a file task_status.txt has value start in the 
/opt/hpws/apache/cgi-bin/trials/bip/data/TESTING/ path of portal server. if the value of the task_status.txt file becomes stop the pop '
up should disappear. There is a preexisting banner in monitorExternalFile1.php stating CBS is under maintenance. convert this banner into a pop up i am uploading code of smart_krish.php and monitorExternalFile1.php make necessary changes in the code of monitorExternalFile1.php and provide me entire file.
 



write a shell script which will run in linux server. there is a file task_status in /opt/hpws/apache/cgi-bin/trials/bip/data/TESTING/,
 if this file has value start rename smart_17.php to smart_Krish.php present in /var/www/html/pace/Online_portal/pages path of portal server.
and when value in task_status is stop, smart_krish.php will be renamed to smart_17.php and smart_Krish_bkp will be renamed to smart_Krish.php in 
/var/www/html/pace/Online_portal/pages path of portal server.
