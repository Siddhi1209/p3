üïí Chronological Timeline of Events

1. Before 21:30 IST ‚Äì Pre-Switch Preparations:

Scheduled activity: Interest Rate Change planned for the night of 15th June 2025.

Due to this, an early branch cutoff was initiated.

BLT queues were scaled to 100 on each application server in anticipation of increased load.



2. 21:39:47 IST ‚Äì Region Switch Completed:

REGION_SWITCH_DAY_TO_NIGHT job completed successfully.

Region officially switched to Night mode.



3. ~21:40 IST ‚Äì Queue Buildup Begins:

Intermittent queue buildup observed on multiple application servers.

Predominantly affected: BLT queue.

Other impacted queues: CIF, DP4, DEPQ, DP9Q.



4. 21:45 IST ‚Äì First-Level Actions Initiated:

Immediate scaling: 8 queues increased per application server.

Queues still not processing ‚Äì suspected to be stuck.



5. 21:50 IST ‚Äì Investigation Started:

Observed abnormal queue behavior and application slowness.

Blocking sessions suspected at the database level.



6. 21:55 IST ‚Äì Blocking Sessions Confirmed:

DBA team confirmed ~1800+ blocking sessions.

PID details shared for the blocked database processes.



7. 22:00 IST ‚Äì Blocking Sessions Cleared:

Blocking sessions were killed.

Corresponding PIDs were disabled at the database level.



8. 22:05 IST ‚Äì Additional Issue Identified:

CDC team was syncing the PR Reference Server to Night DB.

This caused high memory utilization on Night DB, further slowing queue processing.



9. 22:10 IST ‚Äì Database Load Redirected:

Transaction load was switched from Night DB to Reference Server.

Memory pressure on Night DB reduced.



10. 22:25 IST ‚Äì Issue Resolved:

Queue processing normalized across all application servers.

No further blocking sessions or memory issues reported.
