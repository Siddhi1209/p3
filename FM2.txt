Make a unix shell script to monitor 3 types of files PNS,HSL,NAT on showerfeed server.
in showerfeed server if files are present in /fns/id/r/spool/Interfaces/BATCH-UPLOADS-SF-5
directory they are pending. if files are present in /fns/id/r/spool/Interfaces/BATCH-UPLOADS-SF-5/TRICKLE-FEED-REPORTS
directory the files are processed.
i want the script to provide me data in PNS number of files processed,pending followed by
HSL and NAT. i just want numbers sepaarted by commas. for ex- 2,3,0,0,1,2
