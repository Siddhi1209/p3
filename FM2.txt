Incident Timeline and Actions Taken

1. 03:53 – Queue Buildup Observed
During the pre re-sync call, a queue buildup was observed across multiple queues on all applications. Initial attempts to increase the queues were unsuccessful as the queues were getting aborted.

2. 03:55 – Database Session Issue Identified
Upon investigation at the database level, it was found that applications were unable to establish sessions. Node eviction was detected on Node 4, and login attempts to Node 4 were unsuccessful.

3. 04:00 – Node 4 Issue Confirmed
Further verification confirmed access issues with Node 4. This node was assigned to App10, App11, and App16.

4. 04:08 – 04:10 – Gateways Stopped
To isolate the issue, gateways for App10, App11, and App16 were stopped.

5. 04:12 onwards – Replica Redistribution
Replicas were increased on other servers to balance the load; however, the issue persisted.

6. 04:30 – DB Switch Decision
A decision was made to revert the DB switch from Day to Ref, but due to REFPR (pre re-sync) being unavailable, the switch was carried out on the NR Reference.

7. 04:35 – 04:40 – DB Pointing Changed
DB pointing was updated accordingly, and the DB switch from Day to Ref was initiated.

8. 04:44 – 04:59 – DB Switch Executed
The switch from Day to Ref was completed during this time window.

9. Post Switch – Queue Error Persisted
After the DB switch, queues were increased across multiple applications, but the error “INITIALISATION ERROR RUN ABORTED” was still encountered.

10. 04:50 – 04:55 – DB Links Rechecked
DB links and pointings were reviewed again, and it was found that the DBA team had not updated the pointing to NR Reference on their end.

11. 05:02 – 05:05 – DBA Fix and Queue Restoration
After the DBA team corrected the pointing, queues were increased again and started functioning properly. Manual queue increases across all applications were carried out from 05:02 to 05:35.

12. 05:26 – Node 4 Restored
Node 4 (server 10.0.20.54) was reported up.

13. 05:37 – 05:40 – Gateways Restarted
Gateways on App10, App11, and App16 were restarted.

14. 05:45 – 05:50 – Post EOD Backup Call
Post End-of-Day (EOD) backup call was completed.

15. 05:56 – 06:07 – DB Switch Back to Day
DB switch from Ref to Day was carried out successfully.

16. 06:09 – Start of Day (SOD) Initiated
SOD operations began
