

Hi Team,

The file New_AC_*_20260119.dat is generated by the jobs LONGRUN_JOB_REF2_depd0092 and LONGRUN_JOB_REF2_depd0093, which are scheduled under the LONGRUN_JOB_MULTIAPP box.

As per the job flow, on successful completion of LONGRUN_JOB_REF2_depd0093, the job LONGRUN_JOB_REF2_New_AC_send gets triggered. This job is responsible for creating the ftplist and sending the generated file to the destination.

However, it has been observed that although LONGRUN_JOB_REF2_New_AC_send was triggered successfully, it created a zero-byte ftplist. Due to this, the file was not sent to the destination.

Request you to kindly analyze the issue and let us know the root cause and corrective action.

Thanks and regards,
Siddhi
